# Metadata-Generator
This is for generating metadata for fixed collection that has no levels

So basically is need to generate a "Iphone Collection" that has 3 version and 3 different rarity percentages:
1. Iphone Diamond -> 20%
2. Iphone Gold -> 5%
3. Iphone Silver -> 75%

You can also generate images, but in this case is useless because there will be stored on ipfs only 3 different images and then the image link
automatically pick the right name of the corresponding json
